# Introduction

My name is Maelstrom. Certain people may know me as Vega. This is my first ever mod for Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition. It is an insane project that I have been working on for a bit over a year (at a slow pace). A year or two ago I was kinda experiencing burnout for RTS games, as I have played them *a lot*. One day I stumbled across [Civilization Builder](https://krakenmeister.com/civbuilder/) and later as an extension, the Advanced Genie Editor. As a modder and someone who easily absorbs/learns new information, I uh.. to say I liked AGE was an understatement. I sat in it for hours at a time. It made me hella curious. 

This is an experimental mod created purely from a series of what ifs and questions:

- "What if Unique Units had a second upgrade after Elite?
- "People are so used to playing the game so the same way for 20+ years.. how would they react to seeing even stronger Cataphracts, War Elephants and shit?"
- "So the scales are tipped in one direction, so I think I should do the same for a ton of generic units?"
- "Is an additional upgrade to Siege Onager, Heavy Scorpion, Elite Cannon Galleon, Galleon, Fast Fire Ship, and Heavy Demolition Ship gonna cause any problems?"
- "Hmm yeah I should probably add Elite upgrades to units like the Condottiero and shit... maybe?"
- "Should I remake scenario units and integrate them into the game somehow, like Heavy Pikeman, Crusader Knights, Iroquois Warriors and the fuckin Ninjas?"
- "Should I give those latter three a custom upgrade line too?"
- "Would people be okay with upgrade cost modifications, resource node changes and or new technologies?"
- "Would it be an issue if I potentially changed how people played?"
  
The answers? One way to find out. Ya fucking make it into a mod.

## Mod Information 

**Off The Rails** is a mod that adds another level of pain once you reach Imperial Age. It adds an additional upgrade to Castle Unique Units, Generic Units, Other Unique Units that lacked an upgrade, integrates scenario units into the trees, and a little bit more. The mod originally started out as Unique Unit upgrades, but the scale tipped too much in one direction so I started doing it for the rest.

> You want advanced information on the units, or about my mod? [PLEASE SEE MY DATA SPREADSHEET](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lo63eOFyBBlcIGsguk_KXTlGbhizdXJSJFsJYGwFUyo/edit?gid=1663096624#gid=1663096624).

### Summary

- There are about **75** New Units, or mostly new upgrades. 
- The naming scheme of upgrades are as follows: **Royal** for Unique Units, **Imperial** for Generic Units, and **Elite** for units without an Elite Upgrade. There are some exceptions.
- Upgrade Costs were modified to accommodate for new upgrades.
- If a new upgrade was introduced to a unit line with an existing regional unique upgrade, the regional unique upgrade was slightly buffed to accommodate the new unit (the pattern for stat changes were too tight)
- All new upgrades currently benefit from existing technologies, civilization bonuses, team bonuses, etc. For everything outside of a tech tree and team bonus, a Shadow Technology was created and linked to original Technologies, giving me better control of tech/effects.
- All Resource Nodes were increased by 25% 
- A few new technologies were added. Added a new upgrade for Architecture and Dry Dock. One to give love for buildings since new units, and one to fuck around with Transport Ships.
- **DOES NOT CURRENTLY (?) HAVE AI SUPPORT**

### Design Philosophy / Important Notes

Before I get into the new units and go through them all, I want to make something clear. I hate competitive play. I don't care for balance. I never liked playing AoE2 the proper way, like.. build orders and the amount of time it takes to age up. Ranked games. Win Percentages. 1v1 Arabia Stats. I don't care for any of that. I like cool things. I like power and chaos. This is a mod that will very likely cause the game to be played differently. 

This mod is designed for a deathmatch and or scenario game. That being said, I did make an effort for things to be logical. I try to follow a pattern for stat changes, I don't give a new upgrade something that seems too ridiculous, although some might be. Please keep in mind the mod is a work in progress.
